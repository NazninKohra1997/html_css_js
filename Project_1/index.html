             <big><b>This page in a nutshell:</b></big>It is somewhat open to debate whether very short articles can become Featured
             Articles, but consensus tends to be against a set minimum length for FAC.

                    There has often been discussion about whether very short articles can attain Featured article (FA) status.
                    <br>
                    Some editors are opposed to short articles at Featured article candidates (FAC). Many bring up fair arguments, such as potential 
                    overflow of FACs, lack of reviewers, and loss of quality main page TFAs. Other FAC reviewers argue that any article which meets 
                    Wikipedia's notability requirements can become featured. So, should a 500-word (or less) article be able to make FA?
                    Featured articles under 400 words have been proposed. WP:GA was initially designed for such articles, but Wikipedia has appeared to have moved
                    beyond that concept.

                     From the featured article criteria:
                          A featured article exemplifies our very best work and ... It is—
                             (b) comprehensive: it neglects no major facts or details;
                        For some article topics, a few hundred words might be enough to spell out all major facts and details, so a short article might be comprehensive. It is not
                        advisable to add material for the sole purpose of making an article longer, as quantity is not the same as quality. This raises the question of whether any
                        valid article could, solely via the efforts of Wikipedia editors working from available sources, attain featured status.
